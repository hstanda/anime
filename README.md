# ReactJS application for listing anime

## Features:

- Query for the list of anime
- The input should be a typeahead that renders anime names. When typing into the typeahead, the search results are fetched and displayed. There is NO "Submit" or Search button. Data should be fetched on input change.
- Upon clicking on an anime, we should be directed to a page dedicated to that anime.
- Feel free to make use a design of your choosing, but I expect a nice UI and UX when executing the search
- Make intuitive UI considerations, add comments if necessary to explain your decision thought process.
- General best practices around component structuring
